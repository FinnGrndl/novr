/// Restores the one thing a screen-space canvas provided for free and a
/// world-space canvas does not: an edge.
///
/// The game parks UI it does not currently want by moving it outside the canvas
/// rect — the gameplay MFD screens sit at local x = ±2560 on a 1920-wide canvas
/// while closed. On a ScreenSpaceOverlay canvas that is enough, because there is
/// nothing to rasterise them into; the screen *is* the clip. NOVR converts these
/// canvases to WorldSpace, where the rect is just a number and the geometry is
/// ordinary geometry, so the parked panels become real objects hanging beside
/// the pilot. Seen from the cockpit they read as two faint white rectangles far
/// left and right, apparently in the HUD plane, because that is exactly where
/// they are — the MFD panel backgrounds, white, 450×650, viewed nearly edge-on.
///
/// So: anything whose rect lies entirely outside the canvas rect gets culled.
/// Entirely outside, not partially — a partially visible element is something
/// the pilot is meant to see part of, and hiding it would be a worse bug than
/// the one being fixed. Culling through CanvasRenderer.cull is what RectMask2D
/// itself uses; a RectMask2D would also clip the partial cases, but it works by
/// driving a shader clip rect, and this fork has already been bitten once by UI
/// masking that did not survive the world-space conversion (see the render-queue
/// notes in the research repo). Culling depends on no shader support at all, and
/// its worst failure is that something stays visible.
